# Project Summary

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **PL/SQL:** Used for scripting and database operations.
- **Oracle Database:** Managed data storage and operations.
- **DBMS_OUTPUT:** For debugging and output display in PL/SQL scripts.
- **SQL:** For querying and manipulating data in the Oracle database.
- **Wireshark:** Utilized for network packet analysis and troubleshooting.

## Tasks and Challenges

### 1. Exception Handling in PL/SQL
- **Task:** Implemented exception handling in PL/SQL scripts to manage errors and maintain data integrity.
- **Solution:** Created custom exceptions and used them to handle specific conditions, such as when a counter value exceeds a set limit or when a calculated bonus falls below a minimum threshold.
- **Learning:** Gained expertise in using exception handling to control the flow of PL/SQL programs and manage unexpected scenarios.

### 2. Dynamic Data Manipulation
- **Task:** Performed dynamic data insertion, updating, and deletion in the `dept` table.
- **Solution:** Developed PL/SQL blocks to handle errors during data manipulation, logging these errors into a `log_error` table for tracking and analysis.
- **Learning:** Enhanced skills in SQL data manipulation and error logging to ensure robust data operations and better error management.

### 3. Error Logging Mechanism
- **Task:** Created a logging mechanism to capture and store database errors.
- **Solution:** Designed and implemented a `log_error` table to record error details such as error codes and messages, and integrated this with exception handling blocks.
- **Learning:** Improved understanding of database error handling and logging practices for better troubleshooting and maintenance.

### 4. Wireshark Labs
- **Task:** Completed various network analysis labs using Wireshark to analyze and troubleshoot network traffic.
- **Learning:** Acquired practical knowledge in network packet analysis, understanding protocols like HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, DHCP, and ICMP.

## Key Learnings
- Proficient in PL/SQL for exception handling, data manipulation, and error logging.
- Gained experience in using Oracle SQL for dynamic data operations and network analysis using Wireshark.
- Developed a comprehensive approach to handling errors and ensuring data integrity in database operations.
