# SQL Query Practice Project

## Overview

This project involved practicing and mastering SQL queries to manage and retrieve data from relational databases. The tasks ranged from basic SELECT statements to complex joins and data manipulation. The goal was to become proficient in writing efficient SQL queries and understanding key database concepts.

## Technologies Used

*   SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing and manipulating databases
*   Oracle SQL Developer for running and testing SQL queries

## Tasks and Solutions

*   **Q1: Retrieving Specific Data (Tokyo locations):** Filtered data with the `WHERE` clause and `UPPER` function for case-insensitive matching.
*   **Q2: Concatenating Fields (formatting addresses):** Used the `||` operator for concatenation and `LIKE` for pattern matching.
*   **Q3: Self-Joins (employees and bosses):** Joined a table to itself to relate rows.
*   **Q4: Aggregating Data (counting employees per department):** Used `GROUP BY` and `COUNT`.
*   **Q5: Calculating Sum (total salary by department):** Used `SUM` and `TO_CHAR` for formatting.
*   **Q6: Combining Multiple Fields (full address for departments):** Joined tables and concatenated fields into a formatted string.
*   **Q7: Identifying Duplicate Records (employees with the same last name):** Used subqueries and `HAVING` clause.
*   **Q8: Filtering with Complex Conditions (sales employees with different bosses):** Applied complex `WHERE` conditions.
*   **Q9 & Q10: PL/SQL Blocks (variable usage and nested blocks):** Introduced basic PL/SQL syntax and explored concepts of variable scope and block structure.

## Key Learnings

*   **SQL Syntax and Functions:** `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, aggregate functions, etc.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Concatenation, formatting, pattern matching
*   **Joins:** Inner joins, outer joins, self-joins
*   **PL/SQL:** Basic blocks, variables, scope
*   **Data Analysis Mindset:** Identifying patterns, handling missing data, extracting insights
