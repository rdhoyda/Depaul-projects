Wireshark Labs Summary

Technologies Used
- Wireshark: Network protocol analyzer.
- Network Protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, DHCP.
- Commands and Tools: nslookup, tracert, ping, ipconfig, HTTP GET/POST methods.

Problems Solved
- HTTP Lab: Captured and analyzed HTTP GET and POST requests.
- DNS Lab: Used nslookup to query DNS records and understand DNS resolution.
- TCP Lab: Analyzed TCP three-way handshake and TCP congestion control using Wireshark's graphing utilities.
- UDP Lab: Captured and analyzed DNS queries over UDP.
- IP Lab: Used tracert and ping plotter to understand IP datagram behavior and TTL field decrements.
- DHCP Lab: Observed DHCP process using ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew.
- ICMP Lab: Captured ICMP packets to understand ping responses and network troubleshooting.
