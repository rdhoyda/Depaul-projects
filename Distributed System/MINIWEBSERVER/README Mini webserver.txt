# MiniWebserver Project Summary

## Overview

The MiniWebserver project is a foundational exercise in building a simple web server using Java. This project involves handling HTTP requests, parsing query strings, and dynamically generating HTML responses.

## Technologies Used

1. **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the MiniWebserver.
2. **Sockets**: Utilized for establishing and managing network connections.
3. **HTTP Protocol**: The server handles HTTP GET requests and responds with appropriate HTML content.
4. **HTML**: Used to create the input forms and display dynamic content.

## Project Components

### MiniWebserver.java

- **Socket Communication**: Established a server socket to listen for incoming connections on port 2540.
- **Multithreading**: Used to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Parsed incoming HTTP GET requests to extract query parameters.
- **Dynamic HTML Generation**: Generated HTML responses based on the parsed query parameters.

### WebAdd.html

- An HTML form that allows users to input their name and two numbers. This form submits the data to the MiniWebserver for processing.

### MiniWebPostings.txt

- A log of at least two postings to the D2L MiniWebserver forum, documenting discussions and insights about the project.

## Key Tasks and Achievements

1. **Setting Up the Server**: Successfully created and configured the MiniWebserver to listen for client connections and handle HTTP requests.
2. **Handling Form Submissions**: Parsed query strings from the form submissions to extract user inputs.
3. **Generating Dynamic Responses**: Modified the server to return HTML content displaying the user's name and the sum of two numbers.
4. **Continuous Form Submission**: Ensured that the form inputs are preserved and displayed by default on each submission, allowing users to modify and resubmit without reloading the page.
5. **Explanatory Comments**: Added detailed comments to the code to explain the functionality and flow, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Networking in Java**: Gained hands-on experience with Java's networking libraries, specifically in using sockets to manage client-server communication.
- **HTTP Protocol Understanding**: Deepened understanding of how HTTP requests and responses work, including the structure and significance of MIME types.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Learned to generate and manipulate HTML content dynamically based on user inputs.
- **Multithreading**: Developed skills in implementing multithreading to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- **Code Documentation**: Improved ability to document code effectively, making it easier for others (and future self) to understand and work with.

## Potential Extensions

- **File Handling**: Extend the server to handle different types of files, such as serving static HTML pages or other MIME types.
- **State Management**: Implement features to maintain session state, such as tracking the number of requests from a particular user.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Improve the HTML interface for better user experience and additional functionalities.

By completing this project, I have strengthened my skills in Java programming, web server implementation, and network communication, making me well-prepared for more advanced web development and network programming challenges.
