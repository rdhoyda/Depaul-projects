### Project Summary

#### Project Title: Data Visualization and Analysis

#### Technologies Used:
- **R (ggplot2)**
- **Tableau**

#### Problem Statements Addressed:
1. **Stock Market Analysis:**
   - **Closing Price Analysis**: Created a line graph of closing prices over time.
   - **Volume Analysis**: Developed a bar graph to visualize trading volume over time.
   - **Volume vs. Price Range**: Constructed a scatter plot to study the relationship between trading volume and daily price range.

2. **Automobile Price Analysis:**
   - **Treemap and Bubble Chart**: Analyzed automobile prices using treemaps and bubble charts, focusing on the "Make" and "Model" subdivisions.
   - **Comparison of Visualizations**: Evaluated the effectiveness of treemaps versus bubble charts in displaying car price distributions.

3. **Population Growth Analysis:**
   - **Individual Reservation Growth**: Plotted population growth for individual reservations over the years.
   - **Total Reservation Population**: Graphed the total population growth across all reservations, subdivided by individual reservations.

4. **Visual Perception and Data Integrity:**
   - **Pre-attentive Attributes**: Explained the role of pre-attentive attributes in data visualization and their effectiveness when combined.
   - **Weberâ€™s Law in Bar Charts**: Discussed the importance of including zero in the numerical axis of bar charts to maintain accurate data representation.

5. **Cell Phone Plan Comparison:**
   - **Plan Comparison Using Bar Charts**: Created grouped bar charts to compare cell phone plans offered by different companies, highlighting cost and data allowances.
   - **Price vs. Data Bandwidth**: Developed scatter plots to show the relationship between data bandwidth and plan costs across various companies.

#### Key Learnings:
- **Technical Skills**: Gained proficiency in using R (ggplot2) and Tableau for data visualization, enhancing the ability to present complex data in an understandable and visually appealing manner.
- **Data Interpretation**: Improved skills in interpreting and comparing different types of data visualizations, understanding their strengths and limitations.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Enhanced ability to analyze and derive insights from data, such as identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **Visual Design Principles**: Learned the importance of design principles in creating effective visualizations that are easy to comprehend and communicate the intended message clearly.

These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in data visualization and analysis, making me adept at using visual tools to solve real-world problems and derive actionable insights.
