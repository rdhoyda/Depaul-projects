# Project Overview: Data Visualization Techniques

## Project Summary

In this project, I explored various advanced data visualization techniques to analyze and derive insights from a given dataset. The goal was to create compelling visualizations that not only present the data effectively but also uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that could inform strategic decisions.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Bertin Matrix**: Used to analyze the relationship between categorical variables ('day type' and 'mean temperature').
- **Packed Bubble Chart**: Employed to visualize hierarchical data and illustrate the frequency of rides across different categories (weekdays vs. weekends/holidays).

## Problem Solved

### Bertin Matrix
The Bertin matrix provided a comprehensive view of the frequency distribution of mean temperatures across different day types. This visualization highlighted several key insights:
- **Seasonal Trends**: Certain day types were more prevalent in specific temperature bands, indicating potential seasonal trends.
- **Outliers and Anomalies**: The visualization revealed outliers and unexpected occurrences that warranted further investigation.
- **Service Planning Implications**: Potential correlations between day types and temperature ranges suggested strategic planning opportunities for services based on weather conditions.

### Packed Bubble Chart
The packed bubble chart visualized the disparity in ride frequencies between weekdays and weekends/holidays. Key findings included:
- **Hierarchical Data Representation**: The chart's hierarchical arrangement allowed for easy comparison of different categories and subcategories.
- **Demand Patterns**: A notable increase in ride demand during weekdays compared to weekends/holidays was observed, indicating a higher necessity for transportation services on business days.
- **Data Anomalies**: Outliers were identified through unusually sized bubbles, prompting further investigation.

## Learnings

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:
- **Advanced Data Visualization Techniques**: Understanding and applying complex visualizations like the Bertin matrix and packed bubble chart.
- **Data Analysis and Interpretation**: Extracting meaningful insights from visual data representations.
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Utilizing data-driven insights to inform operational strategies and service planning.

These skills and experiences are valuable for roles in software development and data analysis, where data visualization plays a crucial role in making informed decisions.
