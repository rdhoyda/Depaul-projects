### Project Overview

#### Project Title: Automated Testing for DePaul University Bookstore

#### Technologies Used:
- **Selenium IDE**: An integrated development environment for Selenium scripts. It is implemented as a Chrome and Firefox extension, and allows you to record, edit, and debug tests.

#### Problem Solved:
This project aimed to automate the purchase pathway scenario for a specific product on the DePaul University Bookstore website. The automation ensures that the website functions as expected during the product search, filtering, selection, and checkout processes.

#### Tasks Performed:
1. **Startup and Initialization**:
    - Opened Selenium IDE and started a new recording project.
    - Entered the base URL for the DePaul University Bookstore.

2. **Product Search and Filter**:
    - Searched for "earbuds" and applied filters for brand, color, and price.
    - Selected the JBL Quantum True Wireless Noise Cancelling Gaming Earbuds.

3. **Cart Operations**:
    - Verified product details and added the item to the cart.
    - Confirmed the cart's status and proceeded to checkout.

4. **Checkout Process**:
    - Proceeded through the checkout steps including contact information, pickup information, and payment information.
    - Verified details at each step to ensure data integrity.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - Applied an invalid promo code to test error message display.
    - Verified all necessary error and confirmation messages.

6. **Script Validation**:
    - Used Selenium’s “verify” commands to ensure proper execution without interruptions.
    - Cleared the browser cache between script runs to maintain accuracy.

#### Learnings:
- **Automation Proficiency**: Gained hands-on experience in using Selenium IDE to automate web applications, enhancing skills in automated testing and quality assurance.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developed a structured approach to automate complex workflows, identifying potential pitfalls and ensuring smooth execution.
- **Attention to Detail**: Enhanced attention to detail by validating various aspects of the user interface and workflow, ensuring the automated tests were thorough and reliable.
- **Testing Best Practices**: Learned the importance of using verification commands over assertion commands in the context of automated testing for more flexible and informative test results.

This project showcases the ability to apply automated testing tools to real-world scenarios, ensuring web application reliability and user satisfaction. The comprehensive automation of the purchase pathway scenario demonstrates proficiency in using Selenium IDE and contributes to the development of robust software testing skills.
