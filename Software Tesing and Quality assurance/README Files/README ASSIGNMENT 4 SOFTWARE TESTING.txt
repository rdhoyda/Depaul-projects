### Project Summary

#### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Tools:** Excel for defect tracking and documentation

#### Problem Solved:
This project involved identifying and documenting defects in the `CarCarrierTruck` class of a Java application. The main issues addressed were related to:

1. **Validation Errors:** Inadequate validation logic for truck ID.
2. **Error Messages:** Inconsistent and incorrect error messages in the `loadUpperLevel` method.
3. **Code Comments:** Errors in comments due to copy-paste mistakes in the `loadLowerLevel` method.
4. **Logical Errors:** Missing conditions to check if upper or lower levels are empty before unloading.
5. **Assumptions in Logic:** Incorrect assumptions in the `isUpperLevelEmpty` method, affecting the logic.

#### Learning Outcomes:
- **Defect Identification:** Enhanced ability to identify various types of software defects, including validation, logical, and comment-related errors.
- **Defect Documentation:** Improved skills in documenting defects accurately with detailed descriptions, severity levels, and suggested resolutions.
- **Analytical Thinking:** Strengthened problem-solving skills by analyzing and resolving issues within a software application.
- **Attention to Detail:** Increased attention to detail through meticulous review and correction of code and comments.

This experience significantly contributed to my understanding of software testing and quality assurance, preparing me for roles that require rigorous testing and debugging skills.
